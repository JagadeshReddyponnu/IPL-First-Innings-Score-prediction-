Sure, Jagadeshwar! Here's a simple and detailed description for your **IPL First Innings Score Prediction** project using **Machine Learning**:

---

### 🏏 **Project Title**: IPL First Innings Score Prediction using Machine Learning  
### 🤖 **Domain**: Machine Learning (Regression Problem)  
### 💻 **Language Used**: Python  
### 📦 **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

### 📄 **Project Description**:

The **IPL First Innings Score Prediction** project is a machine learning-based solution to predict the final score of a team batting first in an IPL match. The idea is to use historical match data to train a model that can forecast the total runs a team might score by the end of their innings based on various input factors available during the game.

This project applies **supervised machine learning**, especially **regression algorithms**, to make continuous value predictions.

### 📊 **Dataset Features (Example)**:

- Batting Team  
- Bowling Team  
- City  
- Current Score  
- Overs Completed  
- Wickets Fallen  
- Runs in Last 5 Overs  
- Balls Left  
- Current Run Rate  
- Target (Optional)

---

### 🔍 **Steps Involved**:

1. **Data Collection** – Gather IPL match data (e.g., from Kaggle or cricsheet).
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables (like team names), normalize numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Add new meaningful features like:
   - Balls left in innings
   - Run rate
   - Wickets remaining
   - Momentum from last 5 overs
4. **Model Selection** – Use regression models like:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Tree Regressor  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - XGBoost Regressor
5. **Model Training and Evaluation** – Split data into training and testing sets, train the model, and evaluate it using metrics like **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **R² score**.
6. **Prediction** – Input current match status (e.g., 10 overs, 70 runs, 2 wickets) and predict final score.
